The front differential is a crucial component of the G-Class's advanced <strong>four-wheel-drive system</strong>, allowing the front wheels to rotate at different speeds during turns while maintaining optimal traction.</p><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The G-Class stands out in the luxury SUV segment with its unique <strong>three locking differentials</strong> systemâ€”front, center, and rear. When engaged, the <strong>locking front differential</strong> locks the front wheels together, forcing them to rotate at the same speed. This feature proves invaluable in extreme <strong>off-road situations</strong>, allowing the G500 to maintain forward momentum even when one wheel loses traction. Such engineering contributes to the G-Wagen's ability to conquer diverse terrains, from rocky mountain trails to desert dunes, reinforcing its reputation as a go-anywhere vehicle.</p>`;
